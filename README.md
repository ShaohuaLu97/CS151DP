# CS151DP

With your group, prepare a 3 minute presentation. Your tasks are: 

Implement the privacy-preserving system you designed in the previous checkpoints (6pts)
  Create a GitHub project with your code and include a link with your submission 
Show the result of 5 or more different analytics queries (6pts)
  Explain how the privacy budget will be used amongst these queries and why
Plot the runtime and error of your queries as a function of the privacy budget (6pts)
  10 total plots where the X-axis will be epsilon for all plots and the Y-axis is either runtime or error
  For each value of epsilon, plot the outcome of 10 executions to show the spread of results
Discuss if your previous privacy budget choices still make sense (2pts)
  Compare the analytical result from checkpoint 3 with the empirical results of checkpoint 4
